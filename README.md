# The Impact of Greenhouse Gases in Cosmetics on Global Warming

## Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze how tranportation-related greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global warming and climate change . My goal is to better understand the environmental impact of commonly used cosmetic products and raise awareness that could help reduce emissions.

## Objectives
The goal of this project is to analyze the impact of greenhouse gases in cosmetics on global warming by correlating data on cosmetic industry emissions and climate change indicators. This project aims to provide insights into how cosmetic product ingredients contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and may suggest sustainable alternatives to reduce their environmental impact.

1. **Understand Environmental Impact:**
Explore the relationship between cosmetic product ingredients, greenhouse gas emissions, and global warming, identifying how different chemicals contribute to atmospheric pollution.

2. **Identify Main Contributors:**
Pinpoint which cosmetic chemicals and production processes have the highest carbon footprint and assess their role in climate change acceleration.

3. **Sustainable Alternatives:**
Analyze eco-friendly cosmetic options and their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, providing insights into more sustainable consumer choices.

4. **Apply Data Science Skills:**
Utilize data science techniques to analyze emissions data, climate trends, and industry reports, applying the concepts learned in DSA 210 to a real-world environmental issue.

## **Description of Dataset**

The dataset for this project consists of records on greenhouse gas emissions and cosmetic industry data collected over several months. Here’s what I’ll be tracking:

**Date:** The specific day of the recorded emissions data

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** 
Total CO₂, CH₄, and other greenhouse gas emissions (measured in metric tons) from the cosmetics industry

**Cosmetic Product Category:** 
Type of cosmetic product (e.g., skincare, haircare, perfumes, sprays)

**Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs):** 
Amount of VOCs released from cosmetic products (measured in micrograms per liter)

**Aerosol Usage:** 
Frequency of aerosol-based product usage and its estimated emissions impact

**Sustainability Rating:** 
Eco-friendliness score of products based on sustainability reports (scale of 1–10)

**Brand Carbon Footprint:** 
Estimated carbon footprint of different cosmetic brands based on public reports

**Global Temperature Trends:** 
Historical temperature data corresponding to emission records

**Regulatory Impact:** 
Presence of government policies or industry regulations affecting emission levels

## **Motivation**

Greenhouse gas emissions from various industries contribute significantly to climate change and global warming. However, the impact of the cosmetics industry on greenhouse gas emissions remains relatively unexplored. Understanding how different cosmetic ingredients and production processes contribute to atmospheric pollution may help in developing more sustainable consumption habits and eco-friendly product alternatives.

By analyzing data from environmental agencies and industry reports, I hope to:
- Understand the relationship between cosmetic product ingredients, greenhouse gas emissions, and global warming trends.
- Identify key contributors within the cosmetics industry that have the highest environmental impact.
- Gain actionable insights into how switching to sustainable cosmetics could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.

## Tools and Technologies

I will rely on the following tools for data analysis and visualization in this project:


-**Python:** For data cleaning, preprocessing, and statistical analysis

-**Pandas:** To manipulate and process environmental and industry emission data

-**Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For visualizing trends in greenhouse gas emissions, temperature changes, and industry impact (scatter plots, heatmaps, time series)

-**SciPy:** For hypothesis testing and correlation analysis between cosmetic-related emissions and climate change

-**Scikit-learn:** For implementing regression models and predicting emission trends

-**Jupyter Notebook:** For organizing and presenting analyses in an interactive environment

## Analysis Plan

1. **Data Collection**

Import greenhouse gas emissions and cosmetic industry data into a Pandas DataFrame and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and standardizing units.

3. **Visualization**
Use scatter plots, heatmaps, and time series plots to explore relationships between greenhouse gas emissions, cosmetic industry data, and global temperature trends.

**Examples include:**

**Scatter plot** of carbon emissions from cosmetic products vs. global temperature changes

**Heatmap** showing correlations between cosmetic ingredients and greenhouse gas levels

**Time series plot** comparing historical CO₂ levels and temperature anomalies over time


3. **Hypothesis Testing**

**Test hypotheses like:**
- H₀ (Null Hypothesis): Cosmetic products have no significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions.
- H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis): Chemicals in cosmetic products significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

Run regression analysis to determine whether there is a significant relationship between cosmetic industry emissions and climate change.


4. **Trend Analysis**

- Investigate patterns in greenhouse gas emissions over time, identifying key contributors from the cosmetics industry.
- Analyze how sustainability efforts and eco-friendly alternatives impact emissions reduction trends.


**Example Analysis**


To illustrate, I’ll create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions from cosmetics and global temperature changes. The x-axis will represent carbon emissions (metric tons) from the cosmetics industry, and the y-axis will show global temperature anomalies (°C). If there is a clear upward trend, it might suggest a strong correlation between cosmetic-related emissions and climate change.

Another example involves comparing **conventional cosmetics with eco-friendly alternatives.** By analyzing emission levels from **traditional vs. sustainable beauty products**, I can determine if switching to eco-friendly options significantly reduces carbon emissions.

Similarly, I’ll examine **greenhouse gas emission trends over time** to see if regulatory policies or industry sustainability efforts have resulted in a decline in emissions. For example, if emissions from the cosmetics industry **decrease following stricter environmental policies, this could indicate that regulations are effective in reducing climate impact.**


## **Conclusion**

By the end of this project, I hope to answer the following questions:

- How do cosmetic product emissions contribute to greenhouse gas levels?

- Is there a measurable correlation between the cosmetics industry and global warming trends?

- Can sustainable alternatives significantly reduce the environmental impact of personal care products?
  
- How can these insights be applied to encourage more eco-friendly consumer choices?


  
This project isn’t just about analyzing emissions from cosmetics; it’s about leveraging data science to gain a deeper understanding of environmental sustainability. Whether in the beauty industry or other sectors, data-driven insights can help shape more responsible production and consumption habits to mitigate climate change.
