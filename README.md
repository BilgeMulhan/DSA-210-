## Objectives
The goal of this project is to analyze the impact of greenhouse gases in cosmetics on global warming by correlating data on cosmetic industry emissions and climate change indicators. This project aims to provide insights into how cosmetic product ingredients contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and may suggest sustainable alternatives to reduce their environmental impact.

1.**Understand Environmental Impact:**
Explore the relationship between cosmetic product ingredients, greenhouse gas emissions, and global warming, identifying how different chemicals contribute to atmospheric pollution.

2.**Identify Main Contributors:**
Pinpoint which cosmetic chemicals and production processes have the highest carbon footprint and assess their role in climate change acceleration.

3.**Sustainable Alternatives:**
Analyze eco-friendly cosmetic options and their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, providing insights into more sustainable consumer choices.

4.**Apply Data Science Skills:**
Utilize data science techniques to analyze emissions data, climate trends, and industry reports, applying the concepts learned in DSA 210 to a real-world environmental issue.

## **Description of Dataset**
The dataset for this project consists of records on greenhouse gas emissions and cosmetic industry data collected over several months. Here’s what I’ll be tracking:

**Date:** The specific day of the recorded emissions data

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** 
Total CO₂, CH₄, and other greenhouse gas emissions (measured in metric tons) from the cosmetics industry

**Cosmetic Product Category:** 
Type of cosmetic product (e.g., skincare, haircare, perfumes, sprays)

**Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs):** 
Amount of VOCs released from cosmetic products (measured in micrograms per liter)

**Aerosol Usage:** 
Frequency of aerosol-based product usage and its estimated emissions impact

**Sustainability Rating:** 
Eco-friendliness score of products based on sustainability reports (scale of 1–10)

**Brand Carbon Footprint:** 
Estimated carbon footprint of different cosmetic brands based on public reports

**Global Temperature Trends:** 
Historical temperature data corresponding to emission records

**Regulatory Impact:** 
Presence of government policies or industry regulations affecting emission levels

## **Motivation**

Greenhouse gas emissions from various industries contribute significantly to climate change and global warming. However, the impact of the cosmetics industry on greenhouse gas emissions remains relatively unexplored. Understanding how different cosmetic ingredients and production processes contribute to atmospheric pollution may help in developing more sustainable consumption habits and eco-friendly product alternatives.

By analyzing data from environmental agencies and industry reports, I hope to:
-Understand the relationship between cosmetic product ingredients, greenhouse gas emissions, and global warming trends.
-Identify key contributors within the cosmetics industry that have the highest environmental impact.
-Gain actionable insights into how switching to sustainable cosmetics could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.
